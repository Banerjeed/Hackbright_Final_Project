# Contributing

If you want to add an issue or pull request, please ensure that the [existing issues](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-py/issues?utf8=✓&q=) don't already cover your question or contribution.

To get started contributing code to the `mapbox-sdk-py` project:

## Installation

We recommend using [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to isolate dependencies for development.
This guide assumes that you have already created and activated a virtualenv for this project.

Ensure that you have the latest version of pip installed:
```
pip install -U pip
```

Clone the repository (alternatively, if you plan on making a pull request and are not in the Mapbox organization, use the [github page](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-py) to create your own fork)
```
git clone git@github.com:mapbox/mapbox-sdk-py.git
cd mapbox-sdk-py
```

Install in "editable" mode with testing dependencies
```
pip install -e .[test]
```

And finally create a separate branch to begin work
```
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```


## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcomed! We'd like to review the design and implementation as early as 
possible so please submit the pull request even if it's not 100%. 
Let us know the purpose of the change and list the remaining items which need to be
addressed before merging. Finally, PR's should include unit tests and documentation 
where appropriate.
